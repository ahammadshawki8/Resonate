# Resonate Flutter App

## Overview
This Flutter project is the frontend for the Resonate platform, a wellness and mood-tracking application. It is fully integrated with a Serverpod backend, providing real-time data, authentication, and user management. All data and authentication flows are handled by the backend—no dummy or local data is used.

## Key Features
- **Serverpod Backend Integration**: All data (voice entries, insights, tags, mood patterns, user settings, etc.) is fetched and managed via the Serverpod backend.
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and session management using Serverpod's identity provider system.
- **Riverpod State Management**: All app state is managed using Riverpod providers, with repositories abstracting backend access.
- **Model Mapping**: Custom mapping extensions convert Serverpod models to frontend models for seamless UI integration.
- **No Dummy Data**: All previous dummy data and mock logic have been removed. The app is now fully reliant on backend data.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Flutter, using custom themes, responsive layouts, and a rich set of wellness features.

## Project Structure
- `lib/`
	- `core/`: Theme, utilities, and core services (including `auth_service.dart` for authentication logic)
	- `data/`: Models, repositories, and (now empty) dummy data file
	- `navigation/`: App routing and shell
	- `providers/`: Riverpod providers for all major data types
	- `screens/`: All UI screens (auth, home, calendar, insights, onboarding, profile, record, settings, splash, trends, wellness)
	- `widgets/`: Shared and custom widgets
- `assets/`: Animations, icons, and images
- `test/`: Widget and integration tests

## Backend Connection Details
- Uses the `resonate_server_client` package (generated by Serverpod) for all API calls
- Authentication and user state are managed via `AuthService` and Serverpod's identity provider
- All providers and repositories fetch, update, and map data from the backend

## Major Refactor Summary
- **Removed all dummy data** from `lib/data/dummy_data.dart` and all screens/providers
- **Refactored all providers** to use backend repositories and mapping extensions
- **Mapped all Serverpod models** to frontend models using extension methods in `lib/data/models/models.dart`
- **Updated all screens** to use backend data and logic (no local or mock logic remains)
- **Fixed all Dart analyzer errors** (import order, null-aware operators, parameter names, unused code)

## How to Run
1. Ensure the Serverpod backend is running and accessible
2. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory
3. Launch the app with `flutter run -d chrome` (or your preferred device)

## Notes
- The app is designed to be cross-platform (web, desktop, mobile)
- All user data, authentication, and wellness features are powered by the backend
- For backend setup and API details, see the `README.md` in the `resonate_server` directory
